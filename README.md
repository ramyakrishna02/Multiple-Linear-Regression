# Multiple-Linear-Regression
Multiple linear regression (MLR), also known simply as multiple regression, is a statistical technique that uses several explanatory variables to predict the outcome of a single response variable. 

It is used to describe relationships between variables by fitting a line to the observed data. Multiple linear regression is used to know how strong the relationship is between two or more independent variables and one dependent variable (e.g. how rainfall, temperature, and amount of fertilizer added affect crop growth).

The goal of multiple linear regression is to model the linear relationship between the explanatory (independent) variables and response (dependent) variable.
